                I am a front end developer who likes to solve my problems with
                code. My overall goal is to build performance systems and to
                develop stable applications.
            </p>

                I am interested in web technologies and develop projects in this
                field. I am especially familiar with
                <strong> Reactjs, Reduxjs and Nodejs.</strong>
            </p>
